This repository contains all my PYTHIA code developed during my project work at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
<!-- The project that I am currently involved in requires the statistical analysis of forward-backward correlatiotions of pp-collisions at CM energies 0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV.
We are interested in studying the correlation function and the deviation in its linear nature at different CM energies.
The methods involved this are numerous, but the one that we currently adopt requires the association of forward-backward correlation function with pseudorapidity gap which is defined as
the separation between a forward pseudorapditiy window and that between a backward pseudorapidity window. -->
